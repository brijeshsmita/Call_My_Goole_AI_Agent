You can use **Google App Engine**, which is a fully managed serverless platform and works well with Vertex AI.

### ðŸš€ Deploying to Google App Engine (Standard Environment)

#### âœ… Step 1: Create `app.yaml`
This file tells App Engine how to run your app.

```yaml
runtime: python310
entrypoint: python main.py

handlers:
- url: /static
  static_dir: static

- url: /.*
  script: auto
```

#### âœ… Step 2: Create `requirements.txt`
Include all your dependencies:

```
flask
google-cloud-aiplatform
```

#### âœ… Step 3: Initialize Google Cloud Project
If you havenâ€™t already:

```bash
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

#### âœ… Step 4: Deploy
From your project directory (where `main.py`, `app.yaml`, and `requirements.txt` are located):

```bash
gcloud app deploy
```

Then open your app:

```bash
gcloud app browse
```

Would you like me to generate the `app.yaml` and `requirements.txt` files for you now?
